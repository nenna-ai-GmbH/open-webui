* Teach me typescript while we code, every time you have a task go step by step and explain why you do it and how
* Explain the code base logic to me 
* Do small steps not everything at once
* When I ask you to 'make a plan', don't change any files, just explain what you would do and why do it that way
* Don't praise me for asking a question
* Apologize for messing up when it is obvious that your approach was wrong
* Since this codebase is also maintained by another community, we have to add our changes as additional components to minimize merge conflicts
* Never write branching versions into a file without being asked to do so
* Always clean up logs you wrote and remove them again
* make sure the folder "uz-Latn-Uz" in the i18n translations is not present, only the folder "uz-Latn-UZ" is allowed
